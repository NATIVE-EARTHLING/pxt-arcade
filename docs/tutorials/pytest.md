In this tutorial, you will build a fairly simple game with the goal of eating a pizza before time runs out. When the player eats a slice of pizza, the countdown is restarted.

## Step 1 @fullscreen

Find ``||scene:set background color to||`` in ``||scene:Scene||``. Drag it into the ``||loops:on start||`` and then click on the grey box to select a new background color.

```spy
// @highlight
scene.setBackgroundColor(7)
```
